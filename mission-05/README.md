# Mission 05: Test Case Mapping and Results Sync

## Goal

Connect BrowserStack Low Code Automation execution back to BrowserStack Test Management so automated results update the correct managed test cases instead of living in a separate silo.

## Requirements

BrowserStack required participants to:

1. Start with an existing Test Management project containing at least one test case and a working Low Code Automation test.
2. Map the Low Code Automation test to Test Management case IDs.
3. Run the mapped test and download the XML report from the Builds section.
4. Upload the test result back into Test Management and confirm execution status updates against the mapped cases.

## Required submission evidence

- Test Management test-run screenshot showing the execution results.
- Exported XML report.

## What I built

- Mapped FashionStack Low Code Automation tests back to BrowserStack Test Management.
- Executed the mapped tests.
- Exported a multi-testcase XML/JUnit-style report.
- Synchronized the automation results back into Test Management.
- Verified results were associated with the intended mapped cases.
