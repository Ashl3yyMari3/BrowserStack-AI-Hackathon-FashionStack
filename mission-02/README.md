# Mission 02: Mastering Data & Enterprise Workflows

## Goal

Build a complete **login -> action -> logout** journey, then refactor it into a maintainable enterprise-style automation design using shared variables, encrypted credentials, and reusable modules.

## Requirements

BrowserStack required participants to:

1. Create a Global Variable such as `UserEmail`.
2. Create an encrypted Secret such as `LoginPassword`.
3. Record a complete login, meaningful in-app action, and logout workflow.
4. Replace hardcoded email/password values with the Global Variable and Secret.
5. Confirm no plaintext credentials remained in the test steps.
6. Turn repeated login steps into a reusable `Login` module.
7. Turn repeated logout steps into a reusable `Logout` module.
8. Create a second test with a different middle action while reusing the same Login and Logout modules.
9. Confirm `UserEmail` showed a **USED IN** count greater than one.
10. Execute both tests successfully in the BrowserStack cloud.

## Required submission evidence

- Public build link showing **both tests passing**, with the Login and Logout modules visible in the execution timeline.
- Screenshot of the Global Variables page showing the shared variable used across multiple tests.

## What I built

- `M02 - Login, Add to Cart, and Logout`
- `M02 - Login, Verify Men Inventory, and Logout`
- Shared `UserEmail` Global Variable
- Encrypted `LoginPassword` Secret
- Reusable `Login` and `Logout` modules
- Two successful end-to-end cloud workflows
